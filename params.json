{"name":"Workflow-as-code","tagline":"An open-source, in-house service platform with a PaaS-like workflow, built on Docker, CoreOS, Etcd and Fleet. This repository houses the documentation and installation scripts.","body":"Workflow-As-Code\r\n================\r\nWorkflow-As-Code uses an [agile DevOps](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/a/effective-devops/268983/) [Infrastructure-As-Code](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/a/infrastructure-as-code/268998/) approach to programmatically develop, use and extend a set of best practices for [learning how to learn AND to eliminate waste/barriers  in serving customers or clients](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/a/hello-startup/268949/). \r\n\r\nThe foundation starts with setting up a development environment on a Mac to set the stage for implementing best practices for a continuous deployment daily workflow. After implementation comes automation.  We want to **collaboratively** automate the execution of the [practices that are worthy of automation](https://xkcd.com/1205/) using Atom as the basis for consistent development environment and a public GitHub repo to encourage others to participate in optimizing a shared standard. \r\n\r\nWorkflow-As-Code applies a [DevOps architectural perspective](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/devops-a-software/9780134049885/ch04.html) to the personal task of organizing a daily workflow ... in order to prepare to use Workflow-As-Code effectively, you should first use a standard configuration utility template like [Laptop](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop) or [Mac OS X Dev Setup](https://github.com/nicolashery/mac-dev-setup), which are both scripts for automating the set up an OS X laptop for software development.\r\n\r\nConsistency in your daily workflow benefits everyone's own time management, not just yours ... but yours also. So Workflow-As-Code is NOT about you [working alone].  There are no requirements for anyone to use Workflow-As-Code; you can pick and choose which parts make sense for you; you can fork it and go your own way.  In life or a job, you can pick and choose which meetings to go to or what time to show up -- Workflow-As-Code is the same in that it aims for consistent, predictable workflows and time management because doing that is respectful of the others on your team and ultimately improves everyone's productivity.\r\n\r\nSo Workflow-As-Code is primarily about trying to practically standardize on shared best practices to avoid continually re-negotiating schedules and to avoid \"re-onboarding\" to fit in.  Accommodating less-than-best practices for team workflow wastes everyone's time, but working on improving your team's productivity enhances your value more than than anything you can do just by yourself. For example, if your team uses an application like Evernote on Mac laptops, then you can \"sharpen the saw\" for everyone on your team by going back to fundamentals, USING the [best practices for a Mac laptop](https://evernote.com/contact/support/kb/#!/search?device=mac&product=evernote) and then developing even better practices and workflow applications that execute those practices using the [Evernote API](https://dev.evernote.com/doc/). \r\n\r\nWorkflow-As-Code starts with optimizing [Github use](https://guides.github.com/) as well as development workflows with [Atom](http://blog.atom.io/) and its [Electron shell](http://electron.atom.io/).  This includes actively participating in the [Github configuration management community](https://github.com/blog) and collaborating on extensible development with the [Github API](https://developer.github.com/v3/).  \r\n\r\nWorkflow-As-Code is not just about development; it can also be extended to marketing/PR or managing professional networking and social media brand with [Hootsuite best practices](https://hootsuite.com/resources) and the [Hootsuite API](https://hootsuite.com/developers/app-directory/docs/api) and ... a host of other [routine things that are readily automatable](https://xkcd.com/1319/). It's not about automation for the sake of automation, but instead it's about [extreme](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork) productivity  --  what's the one simple thing that could be done that would probably work enhance productivity the most in the next hour or two of time spent on development?\r\n\r\nWorkflow-As-Code for any knowledge worker is primarily going to about data and Big Data.  That means developing the proficiency to routinely hack better ways to use more data, to reuse data APIs, to accelerate the improvement knowledge from a firehose of other data sources, such as [using data APIs to track trends](http://www.newswhip.com/api#) in the things that you follow as part of your own personal business intelligence dashboard.
